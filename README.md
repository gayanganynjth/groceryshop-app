I built a four pages website for a grocery shop using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.Following are the main HTML components I used for the grocery shop site.

  🛠️HTML Radio button component for Contact Us button.<br>
  🛠️Corousel for the home page images animation.<br>
  🛠️HTML table component for price tables display in the vegetables,fruits and the groceries pages.<br> 
  🛠️HTML ordered and unordered list component for design terms and condition page.

I created four seperate folders named 'images' for save all the images files, 'js' for save JavaScript files, 'pages' for save all the HTML pages, 'styles' for save all the CSS files.All the HTML pages created using standard structure used 'viewport' keyword for responsive design and used '%' for width instead of 'px' and also 'rem' for font sizes for responsive design.

📌 Mainlly in JavaScript files called "app.js" there are two main functions called 'toggleMobileMenu(),slideNext()' functions and one buit in function called
'setInterval()'.

Happy coding 🚀
